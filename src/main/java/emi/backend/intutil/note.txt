Java's permission scheme might not have a clause for this, but:
DO NOT use stuff in this section in Frontend! I mean it!
Where possible, I've made classes package-local to backend.
Where that's not possible but the classes need to be non-public-API they go here.

Hence, full list of exports should be:

IBackend & IBackendFile (actual interface)
BackendRegistry (needed to access backend)
FileUtilities, LongUtils (Utility classes)

--------------------------------------

Also note that since StructUtils needs to get at everything, relevant classes are public.
This doesn't mean you get to go around messing with IEFB.
